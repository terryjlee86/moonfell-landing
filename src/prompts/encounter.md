# Encounter Bible – Draft v0.1 (Trimmed for Playtest)

This companion document drives moment‑to‑moment encounters (combat flow, actions, gear, morale) and supplements the World Bible. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

## 1) Flow Priority (Cinematic Order)
- Sort by **Speed** at conflict start; ties by **AGI**; otherwise simultaneous beats.  
- New arrivals slot in when they enter range.  
- Narration remains fluid (“As the rat darts closer, you have a window to respond.”) even though the engine slices rounds internally. Debug overlay can reveal ordering in dev builds. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

## 2) Action Economy (≈6‑sec round)
- **Move** (up to Speed, climb, stand) – 1  
- **Primary** (attack, cast, shove, grapple, shield‑bash) – 1  
- **Quick** (draw/sheathe, pick up, open door/pouch) – 1  
- **Free** (short speak, gaze, drop) – ∞  
Backpack retrieval: if worn, costs Quick + Free; if on the ground, costs Primary. Traps/snares = Primary outside combat. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

## 3) Hand‑Slots & Item Distance
Two hand slots total; two‑handers use both. Using a two‑hander one‑handed = improvised (−1 to hit/damage). Buckler + one‑hander is legal; swapping costs a Quick.  
Dropped items are tracked with simple distance tags for natural narration (“about six paces back”). Retrieval prompts depend on Move vs. tag distance. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

## 4) Morale & Disengage
- First casualty in pack → frenzy check.  
- Pack leader killed → flee check.  
- **Universal Reaction Window:** if a foe flees within Max Threat Range, the player gets one reaction beat (Primary or Quick) to chase/throw/cast before they escape. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

## 5) Damage & Status (Examples)
- **Dazzled:** −2 to hit; no Pack Tactics (1 round).  
- **Stunned:** skip next Primary (1 round).  
- **Mana Burn:** −1 Arcana slider step (24h).  
- **Sewer‑rot:** −1 END per 12h until treated. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

## 6) Narration Guidelines
Offer only core verbs (Attack/Defend/Move). Let creativity come from the player prompt. Don’t surface system labels; express risk/time in fiction (“You fumble with the straps; the rat closes two paces.”). Debug overlay is dev‑only. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

## 7) Moonfall (Foreshadowing) – Encounter Layer
Veil‑Season is OFF at launch; celestial truths emerge as fragments (star‑tables, marginalia, ward‑stones, etc.); engine has hidden flags for staged rollout without showing numbers. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

## Bestiary (Reference)
Cathari‑origin fauna with dormant corruption tells: Thornwings, Prismbacks, Mirefolds, Lamplures, Tessellids, and Khyrix; Cathari are Second Crown; Felborn are corrupted kin. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}
